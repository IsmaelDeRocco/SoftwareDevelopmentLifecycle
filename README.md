CS-250-Q1509 Software Development Lifecycle
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User stories are important to a project, due to it being a set of requirements that is coming from the client. When contracted by a company or client, we are in charge of designing a product for them that does the things that they want it to do. These user stories are then completed by the team, to the specifications of the client.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

When developing programs, teamwork is everything. The agile process helps with promoting teamwork and making sure the development process is consistent and time efficient. When using agile, it demonstrates that every team member should be well rounded. There should not be just one person who knows how to do a specific task. Everyone should be able to pull their own weight and be willing to help teach and be mentors to new staff. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

There are many reasons on how to be a good team member on a team but what I would say would be the main reason would be to not criticize a teammate. When you are a team, you are only as strong as your weakest link so, to completely dissolve that, always try to be a mentor or just help your fellow teammates out. In coding people will not always run into the same problems, so its everyone duty to help each other out and make sure to expand everyone’s horizons. In agile, there are not specialized people who only have one task, everyone should be able to handle any task given to them. In that case, when there is something new to a specific member, the team needs to step up and teach that said person the new task, promoting growth.
